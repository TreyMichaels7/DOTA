Project Description
-------------------

As a busy UW student, it can be hard to find time to really spend time looking for love. Each quarter, students spend hours studying for midterms and finals. Not only that, they also have to make time for various group projects and work on dense and difficult homework assignments throughout the quarter. In addition, there might be other priorities and extracurriculars that make it harder to focus on finding the one. However, that is about to change thanks to "Dating on the Ave", an exciting and revolutionary way to make connections with your peers at UW while ensuring you still have time for your other commitments.

How does this work? Well, Dating on the Ave is an online web application that will enable users to sign-up and sign-in to an account where they can establish their own basic user profiles. Profile information might include their name, age, major, pronouns, sexuality, availability, a profile picture or two, as well as a short bio about themselves. Users can also customize what information will be visible to other users. One other thing that users will be asked to optionally fill out is their contact info on other social media or their phone number, but it will not be displayable on their profile.

After the profile is created you are now ready to start using Dating on the Ave. Each day you will be given 3 people's profile cards based on your preferences, and notified when the profiles have changed. Whoever appears on your page, you will appear on their page as well. You will have the opportunity to quickly read their information, and if you're interested, you can ask/invite them to a short 7 minute video chat at a time that works with their availability that will remain pending for about a week. They will be notified and have the option to either accept/decline. If they decline, the invitation will just remain until it expires in a week. If they accept, the meeting will be scheduled and a chat room will open up at the specified time where the two users can get to know each other. There will be a notification that appears around the 5 minute warning indicating the chatroom is going to end soon. At the end of the call a prompt will appear that asks each user if they want to share their contact info with the other person. If both people agree, then their contact info will be shared with each other. Otherwise, no info will be shared. It is important to share contact info if you like someone because you do not get another chance to contact them via the platform after the call regardless of any outcome.

Ideally, this platform will be a means of connecting UW students with one another, and with the video chat functionality, prevent people from threats like getting catfished. You must have a UW email in order to prevent outsiders from also using this application. We want to encourage people who find a connection through these video chats to also continue the conversation, which is why we ask them to share their contact info with each other if they think it's worthwhile. Hopefully, we can help build relationships while fostering a safe environment.

Project Pitch

-   Audience

    -   UW students seeking love

-   Problem

    -   Finding love is hard, especially when you love staying in or are forced to stay in. Online dating apps are full of catfishes, stalkers, and people with bad intentions. Many times what we see online isn't reflective of what the other person is truly like.

-   Solution

    -   Our platform will ensure that people are who they say they are by validating their accounts with an UW email, and also connect people with others via video chatting who would likely be relatively nearby because they would all attend the same school.

-   THE PROFILE

    -   Name, Age, Year, Major (or intended), Pronouns, Short bio (100 characters max), Picture (1 or 2), Favorite Restaurant on the Ave*, Available times

-   THE CALLS

    -   7 minutes video chat (can be ended at any point)

    -   At the end of the 7 minutes, they get to pick yes or no, if both pick yes then they get each other's contact information

    -   If no, then unmatched

    -   The end
